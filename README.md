# Objection_detection

Built a real-time multi-object detection system based on a pre-trained Fast R-CNN model.  
Annotated a custom image dataset using ImageLabel, exporting annotations in Pascal VOC .xml format.  
Developed preprocessing scripts to convert labeled data into Fast R-CNN-compatible input, and fine-tuned the model on the custom dataset.
Integrated OpenCV for real-time video stream capture and detection visualization using bounding boxes.
Demonstrated end-to-end workflow including dataset creation, transfer learning, model deployment, and real-time inference.
